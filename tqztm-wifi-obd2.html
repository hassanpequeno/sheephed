                            <p> There’s quite a few to choose from. I’m willing to pay  for a quality app but wanna ask the experts before I jump in on the first one with positive reviews. Looking at OBDFusion. I've bought an ELM 327 WIFI OBD2 to use it on my Nissan leaf via leaf spy. I just don't know the proper way to get it to work! :( First time I've tried it I've just plugged it into the car, without pressing the brake pedal pressed start engine twice (accessory mode) and it connected immediately to the app. later it works immediately sometimes and sometimes I turn the car multiple times on and off tell it connected. I was wondering what are the username and password for its portal homepage?. Does anyone have one of these? I'm seeing them for really cheap prices online and it seems like it would be neat to have instant access to this info, but I'm not sure what's worth it and what's junk. Any input? Thanks.

I was wondering what are the username and password for its portal homepage?. I'd like to replace my flakey Bluetooth OBD2 reader (a  eBay special) with a more reliable WiFi based one that doesn't depend upon a jailbreak. What do you like? Has it worked reliably for you? Thanks for any suggestions.

I thought this might interest you folks - So my car has a dying mass airflow sensor. 2000 buick regal GS, supercharged 3800. Here's the data that shows that it's obviously in the process of dying. The most interesting image is the last one - https://i.imgur.com/pnGeM4n.png - as it shows all the various ways in which it's dying. Full album: https://imgur.com/a/C48Kx So first some background. A MAF sensor tells the ECU how much air is coming in, measured in grams per second. It basically Warning: wall of text incoming. So I was an absolute moron a few months ago. I hadn't driven Betty in a week or so and it was below freezing so I decided to let her run for a bit to keep her juices going. Long story short, I forget she is running until the next day. Her battery is toasted and she is now out of gas. This is probably my biggest idiot moment of my adult life. I put gas in and jump it. My CEL is on and it's never been on since I owned the car almost 2 years So the car is a 2015 Leaf S, has 10,900 miles, all 12 bars, it has the DC charging package, it's in really good shape, looks almost new, impeccable interior. The manager of the dealership, who offered me the car, is a close friend and assures there's nothing wrong with it. We haven't discussed price yet but he has implied I will be getting a good discount. The sticker price is ,000 (I imagine I'd be getting at least 10% off). 
I wasn't sure if this was the right place to post this, or if it should be on one of the more mechanic focused subs. I bought 2 different obd2 adapters and I can't get either of them to connect. The first one was a super cheap Bluetooth elm327 off Amazon, so I'm willing to believe that it's just doa. The second one though is the Foseal wifi adapter. It seems to have gotten a bunch of good reviews, so either I got supremely unlucky, or I'm doing something wrong. This is all on my 03 civic. I bought an Android phone recently solely for the purpose of using Torque Pro to monitor coolant temps, read codes, etc (primary phone is an iPhone). Recently I upgraded my vehicle to utilize AA and I absolutely love it! However I noticed I cant use AA, connect to my wifi obd2 dongle, and tether to my iPhone for data at the same time. Anyone know if this is even remotely possible to accomplish? I'm thinking there are too many moving pieces for this to be a 1 device solution. I'm not rooted. Hello, I'm back again with another question. I am absolutely loving my WRX, and am finally comfortable with it and want to start adding stuff to it. Before I start doing anything to change the performance, I want to install gauges for baseline information. .and cause they look pretty. I am an information nerd, so anything I can get from the engine in gauge form I am all about. I have played around with the Torque app on my phone using a wifi OBD2 hookup, and it is nice, but I would So yeah the car has the stock FRS HU but apparently doesnt have the GPS unit. So i have a MAP button but it doesnt work. cant believe I didnt try that on the test drive. Anyway the cost of that unit is like 400 bucks and fuck that I can get a whole new HU for like 500-600 and go android route apparently to have a bit of fun with it. I saw the ADAYO HU but it seems to have come and gone a few years ago but thats kind of what I'm looking for or I'll do something like the nexus installs. </p>
