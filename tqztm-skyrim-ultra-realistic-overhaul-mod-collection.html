I am trying to start game with mods. Everything seems to be fine. But textures in Racemenu are ultra blocky, so I have this line in skse.ini: \ Display\ iTintTextureResolution=2048 So.

I recently finished modding my game, and I have a pretty good set up going. I've decided to put together a list of all the texture mods i'm using, plus some extras to make your game a tad bit better.

Also note that this is all based on my personal preference. Some screenshots, they're blurry for some reason.
