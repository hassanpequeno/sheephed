                            <p> I have been trying to figure it out for over a week, and cannot find the answer. I keep getting this error: 8bf53e8 Rar Not Supported: No suitable RAR unpacker installed and every time i go to check the check box for Unpack any TV releases in your TV Download Dir? I get the error that says unrar executable not found. I have installed unrar with brew install, and i have checked my paths, but not sure what else I might be doing wrong. Can someone please help? I've been using UnRarX for almost 2 years now, but it's a very basic tool, I'm looking for something more powerful, for instance, I can't open a rar file to see its contents, If I double click a file with password it tries to decompress and it fails, then I have to enter the password, for big files this is very annoying. EDIT: I don't care too much about creating RARs, but of course it'd be good if a program had this functionality. EDIT: It seems The Unarchiver (http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/una. I routinely download a full television series or a bundle of movies in one torrent. Each episode or movie has it's own RAR archive which makes unpacking them a resource eating waste of time. I have very little terminal code knowledge, but found the following tutorial incredibly easy to follow: If like me, you get tripped up by not having a usr/local/bin folder, enter the following command in the Terminal (without quotes):. ## Security notice: This update includes an update for WinRAR that fixes a security vulnerability that's already being exploited in the wild: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/nasty-winrar-bug-is-being-actively-exploited-to-install-hard-to-detect-malware/ (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/nasty-winrar-bug-is-being-actively-exploited-to-install-hard-to-detect-malware/) ## Improvements and bug fixes since 2.3.7 Changes to newsserver configuration.

So basically I’ve gone through all my tweaks a few times and can’t find which tweak is doing it. It’s not SpringPlus11 and don’t know what tweak it could be. The only thing I could think of causing it is before I had to rootfs, I had a tweak to disable app names and page dots and not sure if that’s still “installed” even though I don’t see it installed.

Someone gave me their EFA-Linker 256Mb flashcart because they couldn't get it to work. Here's how I managed to connect it to a virtual machine on a modern computer. I've spent so much time troubleshooting the damn thing that I figured I should post how I did it in case it helps someone else. #### Prerequisites: An EFA-Linker flashcart and USB cable. I have the 256Mb cart (for GBA), but it should work with other versions too. VirtualBox 6.x (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). 
After iOS 11 released in beta form last year i added it to my iPad Pro (https://imgur.com/gallery/eqmkoWS) immediately. I fell in love with Apple’s direct attention to iPad in iOS 11.

Self-explanatory title: I copied a rar file to my Windows hard drive from within MacOS (because for some reason my Windows 10 install can't even see my Mac hard disk, let alone read from them.), but when I boot into Windows it's not there. I thought maybe it was hidden but no. So then I booted back to MacOS, unrar'd the file so it's just a standard folder containing the data, and back in Windows 10 it's still nowhere to be seen.?! It's almost as if Windows 10 just isn't 'keeping up with'. Release Notes - SABnzbd 1.2.0 ==================================== ## What's new in 1.2.0 - New SSL engine: SSL connections will always negotiate strongest encryption available Strict verification of certificates (optional) Set custom SSL-Ciphers to increase performance (lowers encryption strength) Detail information in Status window on type of encryption used Webserver can use stronger encryption for HTTPS connections - New RAR-file processing with full support for RAR5:. Release Notes - SABnzbd 2.0.0 Beta 1 ========================================================= ## https://sabnzbd.org/downloads ## Changes since Alpha 1 - Windows and macOS releases now also come in 64bit versions. The installers will install the appropriate version automatically. Therefore, on 64bit Windows the installation directory will change to 'Program Files' instead of 'Program Files (x86)'. On Windows our tests showed an additional 5-10% gain in download speed when using. Year 3, time to update. Below you can find links to older versions of this list. As always, interested in conversation below. Let me know of any mistakes made, choice tools I overlooked, and especially anything that can help my processes. Year 2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/4bsj8q/what_are_the_most_essential_apps_for_os_x_in/) Year 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/300chd/what_are_the_most_essential_apps_for_os_x_in/) So using boxen was a failure, it was something I could. Release Notes - SABnzbd 2.0.0 RC 1 ========================================================= ## https://sabnzbd.org/downloads ## Changes since Beta 1 - API changes: `history` and `queue` calls now only contain History/Queue information.
