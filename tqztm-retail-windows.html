They can be activated online and gets linked to your account permanently. (I will send the instructions along with it if needed). I accept paypal and you can message me anytime. I have other MS products keys , so do ask me if you need something. Hello everyone! I’m selling Windows 10 Professional license keys. This comes with both 32bit and 64bit. PM me if you are interested! I have 13 more license keys on stock at the time of posting. I offer discounts for bulk orders. Discord: Sas420#9318. I'm currently on an old machine that has a legit retail Windows 10 Pro license (verified through slmgr -dli). The machine was originally a Windows 7 install that was upgraded to Windows 10 during the free update period. As basically all the hardware is outdated, I build a new PC and installed Windows 10 Pro using an official ISO from Microsoft (but that machine is not yet activated). Since I have a retail license I believe it should be possible to transfer the license to my new machine. I don't know is this right subreddit for this kind of question but I'll try. I just built 8 new PC's for a company, and used old SSDs from previous builds. Because old PC's had OEM Windows, the Windows didn't activate after swapping SSD's to a new computer. So the question is, do people usually buy OEM or Retail Windows' to company environments? Lifespan of PC over there is around 5 years. As a gamer and serial upgrader I regularly trip the Windows authentication flag and have to reactivate my windows (Motherboard upgrades usually do it). I have never failed to get my Windows reactivated after an upgrade but it is always a hassle. The automatic reactivation system doesn't work and it usually ends up with me having to phone Microsoft. I suspect that the fact that I have only ever bought OEM windows is one of the reasons for this. To make matters worse my current Windows Hi everybody. Once again my small army of aged computers is changing as things break and new parts come and go, and I have a Windows 7 key here that I use for older games that refuse to run on 10. I heard somewhere, can't find the source, that the limit is 5? Which means between a pre-merger Alienware, once on a laptop, again on that same laptop with an SSD, once more on a different laptop after that other laptop broke \ I mess around with used hardware that doesn't Can somebody please explain the difference to me I’m not sure I fully understand. I know the retail is ~ more expensive, but is here any benefit? I know that the OEM is tied to one motherboard, so would the retail allow me to now have to buy new Windows 10 if I upgrade my mobo or something. I have 2 Windows 7 Professional keys left Info on Keys: They are geniune retail licenses They can be re-used They can be used on multiple PCs These licenses can activate Windows 7 Professional, 8.1 Professional & 10 Professional > Contact me on discord ( cam#1670 ) or pm > I may restock & I will update the number 
I have the retail version of Windows 8, upgraded for free to windows 10 and I'm upgrading my motherboard and CPU. I heard it is possible to transfer my license. Is it legit? Since my license is windows 8 and the free period to upgrade to windows 10 is over, will I be stuck on Windows 8.1 after the update? Thank. I have 2 Windows 7 Professional keys left Info on Keys: They are geniune retail licenses They can be re-used They can be used on multiple PCs These licenses can activate Windows 7 Professional, 8.1 Professional & 10 Professional Basically, they are the same as if you bought them off of Microsoft.com when they were for sale on there > Contact me on discord ( cam#1670 ) or pm > I will answer any questions asked about my products > I may restock Question in the title for the most part, but also: Can I add ram, upgrade my hardrive, graphics card and motherboard or do I need a new OEM licence everytime I upgrade a component ? Thanks in advance for your input. Purchased a version that isn't compatible with the Steam version and was hoping to trade for one that works. 
Can someone help me understand the difference between an OEM and retail version of windows and what is the differences and limitations. I have the retail version of windows 7 ultimate, and have upgraded to windows 10 for free, on my pc. Will I be able to use my key to reinstall back to Windows 7 if I were to wipe my current PC and move the license to a new one? Or will the key only work for installing windows 10, now? EDIT: re-explaining. </p>
